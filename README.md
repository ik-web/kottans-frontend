## Git Basics
I already knew a little about git. The course was very interesting, I learned about such commands as: diff, reset, fetch, rebase. And the tasks for learngitbranching.js.org helped a lot to get into working with branches. I learned this topic with pleasure, but I will still come back to it to refresh my knowledge of git.

I keep to myself [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).
