## 1. Git Basics
I already knew a little about git. The course was very interesting, I learned about such commands as: diff, reset, fetch, rebase. And the tasks for learngitbranching.js.org helped a lot to get into working with branches. I learned this topic with pleasure, but I will still come back to it to refresh my knowledge of git.

I keep to myself [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).

## 2. Linux CLI, and HTTP

### Linux CLI
I really liked [Linux Survival (4 modules)](https://linuxsurvival.com/). The information was interesting and easy to understand.<br>
To tell you the truth, To tell you the truth, I'm starting to love the command line and Linux OS. Unfortunately, my computer runs on Windows, but it seems to me that I'll switch to Linux in the near future.<br>
My knowledge in this area was small, but thanks to this course, it began to expand.<br>
I learned new commands for myself, such as:<br>
- chmod  (change file permission)
- finger  (view information about users)
- lpr, lpq, lprm  (Send to Printer to Print and / or Cancel)
- grep  (search for a word in the text)
- ps  (see running processes)
- kill / kill -9  (kill / kill immediately running process)<br>

### HTTP
I also learned the HTTP protocol. Information on this topic isn't easy for me.<br>
I'll come back to this material later to repeat it.<br>
HTTP protocol: [part-1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177), [part-2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155).<br>
